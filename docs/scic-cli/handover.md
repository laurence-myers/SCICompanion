# `scic` CLI work: handover

Read this first in a new session. The design is in `docs/scic-cli/plan.md`.
Update this file in the same commit as each step.

## State

- Branch: `feat/scic-cli`, based on `master` at `0dc1fef5`. Not pushed.
- Current step: A1 (next). F1 is committed; its review is the next check.
- Baseline on `0dc1fef5`: the Release build passes; the unit suite passes
  217 of 217 tests in about 4 minutes. After F1: 237 of 237.
- A full rebuild shows 48 old warnings (C4996, C5033, C4267, C4018), all in
  third-party code (GIFLIB, CrystalEdit, a Windows SDK header). A new
  warning in our files is a regression.

## Progress

The steps are the PRs of plan section 9, in this order. There is one commit
for each step, and a follow-up commit if the review finds a problem.

## How to work a step

1. Implement the step. Keep CRLF line endings (AGENTS.md).
2. Build: `MSBuild.exe SCICompanion.sln -m -p:Configuration=Release -p:Platform=Win32`
   (full path: `E:\Apps\Dev\Microsoft Visual Studio\18\Community\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe`).
   Use `-t:Rebuild` after a change to a widely included header, or the stale
   precompiled header gives access violations in unrelated tests.
3. Test: `.\UnitTests\RunTests.ps1` (unit), `-Integration`, or `-Filter`.
   Read the counts in `TestResults\UnitTests.trx`.
4. Negative check: make the new test fail on purpose (revert the fix or
   break it), confirm it fails, then restore.
5. Run `.\UnitTests\Tools\CheckFailureHandling.ps1` (after F1).
6. Commit the step with this file updated. Message: `<type>(scic): <step> <summary>`.
7. Adversarial review: one subagent in an isolated git worktree, told the
   exact commit SHA, told to refute the step, to build with warnings
   visible, and to run the tests. Fix real findings in a follow-up commit.
   Then remove the worktree (`git worktree remove --force`, `git worktree
   prune`) and its branch.

## Gotchas

- `sed -i` in Git Bash rewrites a CRLF file with LF endings. Edit project
  files with the Edit tool or with PowerShell (`[IO.File]::ReadAllText`,
  keep the BOM).
- Every project reads `Directory.Build.props`. `/we4834` (a discarded
  `Result` is an error) applies to our projects, not to Prof-UIS.
- `tl-expected\tl\expected.hpp` is vendored unchanged (LF endings, SHA-256
  in `tl-expected\README.md`). Settings such as `TL_ASSERT` go in
  `Src\Core\Result.h`.

## Decisions and deviations from the plan

- The open questions Q4 to Q13 use the plan's recommendations.
- Revision 4 of the plan (2026-09-23) added phase K and the `scicompile`
  features (plan section 14), at your request.

## Next action

Review F1, fix any real finding, then start A1 (plan section 9, phase A).
