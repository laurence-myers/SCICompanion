# `scic` CLI work: handover

Read this first in a new session. The design is in `docs/scic-cli/plan.md`.
Update this file in the same commit as each step.

## State

- Branch: `feat/scic-cli`, based on `master` at `0dc1fef5`. Not pushed.
- Current step: A2 (next). F1 and A1 are committed; their reviews run in
  the background.
- Baseline on `0dc1fef5`: the Release build passes; the unit suite passes
  217 of 217 tests in about 4 minutes. After F1: 237. After A1: 242.
- A full rebuild shows about 49 old warnings: C4840 in Prof-UIS, C5033 and
  C4018 in GIFLIB and CrystalEdit, one in a Windows SDK header, and C4996
  (`getenv`) and C4267 in the UnitTests helpers (`DecompileHelper.cpp`,
  `TestDecompile.cpp`, `TestBytecodeOracle.cpp`, `TestDecompileBatch.cpp`).
  A warning in a file that a step changed, which the parent commit did not
  have, is a regression.

## Progress

The steps are the PRs of plan section 9, in this order. There is one commit
for each step, and a follow-up commit if the review finds a problem.

| Step | Status | Commit | Review |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 Result foundation | done | `04361133`, review fixes `b499f9ac` | FIX: 2 should-fix, 8 nits; fixed except the Gdiplus `Status`/`Ok` name overlap in `RoomExplorerView.cpp` (latent, not used) |
| A1 Deferred writes | done | `1c4d1c6f` | running |
| A2 Patch writer, size check | not started | | |
| B1 GameSession, core log | not started | | |

## How to work a step

1. Implement the step. Keep CRLF line endings (AGENTS.md).
2. Build: `MSBuild.exe SCICompanion.sln -m -p:Configuration=Release -p:Platform=Win32`
   (full path: `E:\Apps\Dev\Microsoft Visual Studio\18\Community\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe`).
   Use `-t:Rebuild` after a change to a widely included header, or the stale
   precompiled header gives access violations in unrelated tests.
3. Test: `.\UnitTests\RunTests.ps1` (unit), `-Integration`, or `-Filter`.
   Read the counts in `TestResults\UnitTests.trx`.
4. Negative check: make the new test fail on purpose (revert the fix or
   break it), confirm it fails, then restore.
5. Run `.\UnitTests\Tools\CheckFailureHandling.ps1` (after F1).
6. Commit the step with this file updated. Message: `<type>(scic): <step> <summary>`.
7. Adversarial review: one subagent in an isolated git worktree, told the
   exact commit SHA, told to refute the step, to build with warnings
   visible, and to run the tests. Fix real findings in a follow-up commit.
   Then remove the worktree (`git worktree remove --force`, `git worktree
   prune`) and its branch.

## Gotchas

- `sed -i` in Git Bash rewrites a CRLF file with LF endings. Edit project
  files with the Edit tool or with PowerShell (`[IO.File]::ReadAllText`,
  keep the BOM).
- Every project reads `Directory.Build.props`. `/we4834` (a discarded
  `Result` is an error) applies to our projects, not to Prof-UIS.
- `tl-expected\tl\expected.hpp` is vendored unchanged (LF endings, SHA-256
  in `tl-expected\README.md`). Settings such as `TL_ASSERT` go in
  `Src\Core\Result.h`.

## Decisions and deviations from the plan

- The open questions Q4 to Q13 use the plan's recommendations.
- Revision 4 of the plan (2026-09-23) added phase K and the `scicompile`
  features (plan section 14), at your request.
- 2026-09-23, your change of plan: the CLI must work on a game that SCI
  Companion never opened, so it must not rely on `game.ini`. Plan revision
  5 (plan section 3.4) records how: a script-name map from `game.ini` if
  present, `src\*.sc`, `src\*.sco`, derived names, then `nNNN`. S3 now
  comes first in phase S. The CLI creates `game.ini` only with
  `script decompile --game-ini create`.
- `util.cpp` on `master` starts with a stray code fragment (from commit
  `136c9ba1`) that only compiles because MSVC skips everything before
  `#include "stdafx.h"`. It was meant to free the buffer in
  `GetMessageFromLastError`. A small separate commit moves it there.
- A1 keeps `HRESULT CResourceMap::AppendResource(const ResourceBlob&)` for
  the GUI (it shows the error text) and adds `sci::Status WriteResource`
  (no UI) for the engine and the services.

## Next action

Read the F1 and A1 reviews and fix any real finding. Then plan revision 5
(the CLI must work without `game.ini`; see "Decisions"), then A2.
